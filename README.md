# tesla_stock_price

Overall speaking i was interested with introduction of newer tesla mashine models having effect on stock price changes.

EDA analysis.

With this dataset, i tried to analyze stock price changes,percent changes, standard deviations of open prices with outlier detection.
also calculating simple regression model, as well as SMA,MA,ES and autocorrelation with python.
